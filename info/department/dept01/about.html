The Department of Information Science and Engineering (ISE) was established in the year 1992 
with the objective of producing high-quality professionals to meet the demands of the emerging 
field of Information Science and Engineering. 
<br /><br /><strong>Early Years:</strong><br /> 
The department started with an annual sanctioned intake of 30 students. 
The early efforts of the department were devoted to establishing stable and adequate laboratory facilities. 
An equally important task at that time was to enhance the visibility of the department and the popularity of 
the course that was new and not known to many students and parents at that time. The department achieved 
good success on both these fronts within a span of three years. The course became quite popular and the first 
batch has emerged with 100% pass results in the year 1996, produced 5 University ranks out of the possible 10, 
got well-placed in the industry, and brought laurels to the department and the institute. 
<br /><br /><strong>Accreditation and Autonomy:</strong><br />
The Institute has applied to NBA for accrediting the department in 2000. The NBA has accredited the department of 
Information Science and Engineering with ‘B’ grade. The sanctioned strength for B.E in Information Science 
and Engineering became 60 in the year 1999-2000 and then became 90 during the year 2001-2002. 
Now, the intake has been increased to 120. Despite this growth in size, the department is able to maintain its 
quality because of the strength of the QMS procedures and the encouragement provided by the accreditation. 
In view of the consistent progress, the Institute has been granted autonomy in the year 2007-2008 from 
Visvesvaraya Technological University and Government of Karnataka.
