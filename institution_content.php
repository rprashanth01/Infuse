				M. S. Ramaiah Institute of Technology was started in 1962 by the late Dr. M.S. Ramaiah, 
				our Founder Chairman who was a renowned visionary, philanthropist, and a pioneer in creating 
				several landmark infrastructure projects in India. Noticing the shortage of talented engineering 
				professionals required to build a modern India, Dr. M.S. Ramaiah envisioned MSRIT as an institute 
				of excellence imparting quality and affordable education. Part of Gokula Education Foundation, MSRIT 
				has grown over the years with significant contributions from various professionals in different 
				capacities, ably led by Dr. M.S. Ramaiah himself, whose personal commitment has seen the institution 
				through its formative years. Today, MSRIT stands tall as one of India’s finest names in Engineering 
				Education and has produced around 35,000 engineering professionals who occupy responsible positions 
				across the globe.

				<p>
				Having obtained Certification for compliance to ISO 9001:1994 in the year 2000, MSRIT recognized 
				the importance of getting its academic programs assessed by an accreditation body. 
				By then, the National Board of Accreditation (NBA), established by AICTE, was actively engaged in 
				assessing the technical programs in India. Though accreditation by NBA was not mandatory at that time, 
				realizing the value of such an accreditation, MSRIT voluntarily submitted applications to the NBA for the 
				accreditation of several of its major UG programs. After assessment, in February 2001, 
				NBA accorded accreditation to all the major departments of the Institute for their UG programs. 
				Some programs received accreditation at level A for 3 years and some others, at level B for 3 years. 
				This accreditation process helped the Institute in understanding better its strengths and weaknesses and 
				thus in setting higher goals of quality for itself.
				</p>
				<p>
				At the end of the three years of the validity of the first accreditation by NBA, MSRIT again applied to NBA, 
				in the year 2004, for the accreditation of all of its eligible UG Programs. After assessment during June 2004, 
				NBA accorded accreditation to all the programs assessed by them.
